Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balances.

This application will do the following: 

- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- A student can enroll in the following courses: 
    - History 101
    - Math 101
    - English 101
    - Chemistry 101
    - Computer Science 101  
- Each course costs $600 to enroll
- The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- To see the status of the student, we should ssee their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
